title: New Blog
---

(test) This is a new blog. Again. I'm using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) because it's really simple. Everything's static HTML. There's no admin area or dashboard. There's no database or authentication. I write posts [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) inside Sublime Text, run a script, then upload the generated files. So old school. So simple.

At first I was worried about posting when I was out and about. But I don't post when I'm at my computer, let alone when I'm out and about. I've got a bad habit of chasing solutions to problems that don't really exist. _What if?_ In reality, the majority of my blog posts are "New Blog" posts.

The design (as of this writing) is dead simple. No images, no web fonts, no JavaScript (aside from maybe Google Analytics, eventually). There's very little CSS. The majority of it comes from the Compass Vertical Rhythm imports, which I'm kind of obsessed with.

The fanciest thing is the syntax highlighting that ships with Jekyll.

{% highlight php %}
<?php echo 'Woot!'; ?>
{% endhighlight %}
