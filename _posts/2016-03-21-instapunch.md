title: Dusting Off an Old Project

About 4 years ago, I built a tool to help me get through my [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com) list a little faster. I love love love love _love_ Instapaper, but it's not without its (very minor) shortcomings.

While its full-text search feature works like a champ, it can take a few seconds. In the iOS apps, once you select a search result, you can't then _act_ on it, whether it be starring, archiving, or deleting. Additionally, once you close the selected search result, you've gotta search again, as the results are cleared.

I needed something that would allow me to quickly filter articles by their titles and give me some options, allowing me to knock out my read later list. So I built [instaPUNCH](https://instapunch.me). It's a pretty niche tool for a very specific use-case, but it's really useful for me.

In an effort to kind of increase my web presence over the past few months, I decided it would be cool to pull out an old project and see if it still stands. And it does! It's far, far, far from perfect, and I plan on completely rewriting it soon, but it's super-cool to revisit an old, almost forgotten about project and see that it still works.

So, if you're an Instapaper user who's looking for a tiny side-kick for the service, check out [instaPUNCH](https://instapunch.me) and knock out your read later list!
